					<p>Working independently on the user's experience, I have composed interfaces for several real-world applications. Included below are interactive proofs of concept to demonstrate a possible user experience to my collaborators. While these concepts were implemented in the real world, the code used here is not production ready. </p>

				<h3>Intelligent Tutoring System</h3>
				<p>Objective: Case Western Reserve University's Elementary Computer Programming class wants an online homework help intelligent tutoring system. To overcome student's hesitancies of asking for help, a user experience needs to make students want to come, stay, and return. </p>

				<p><a href='ITS/index.html'>This demo</a> explores how bright colors, funny headlines, and simplicity can combine to create an interface that follows the mental scripts of a live human tutor. Hopefully, this interface, combined with useful information, will leave the user feeling that this tutoring system is a safe, helpful place. <cite>note: any username / password works.</cite> </p>

				<p>I presented <a href='ITS-ePoster/index.html'>this poster</a> at Intersections: SOURCE Symposium to describe the design process to one of the project's funders.</cite> </p>

				<h3>Clipboard</h3>
				<p>Objective: After a year of development, the management console of Clipboard was impossible for even its developers to use. A user experience had to be created that allowed high school band directors to navigate the custom developed student management system and quickly accomplish their tasks on multiple devices. </p>
	
				<p><a href = 'clipboardGui/index.html'>This demo</a> proposes a new interface that has a common look, feel, and capability across all devices. The user needs a small learning curve, so the distinct layout is based on other common applications. The user needs narrow windows on desktop in addition to on mobile, so the interface dynamically adapts the width of the window. The user needs full capabilities on mobile, so the narrow width interface offers full capabilities with smaller menus. With luck, this results in an interface that falls away and lets the data shine. <cite>For demonstration purposes, this demo illustrates a workflow for viewing students' arrival times at an event. As a result, only the Time / Select Event link works.</cite></p>
