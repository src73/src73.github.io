An automated solution
---------------------
In an ideal world, we would tutor our students one on one. However, this is not always best for busy or shy students. To augment the face to face help available to students, an automated help system would be best. Automated systems of this nature are typically identified as Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). 

Help system
-----------
Problematically, students frequently do not ask for help because they do not know they need it. This problem is especially prevalent with students like our target demographic who are not experts in their field.

Welcome 
--------------
All students start at the welcome screen. While logging in may seem unimportant, the welcome screen sets the tone for the ITS. On this screen, students

- answer a question
- give the ITS permission to help them.

For students who are terrified of either asking questions or admitting that they need help, this easy question is a gateway into the world of more complicated questions later in the system.

                  </div>
                  <div class = 'half'>

Question screen 
--------------
Questions are where the student learns. Primarly, learning is done though analogy; students will answer one question, and then answer another that is slightly related. Answering questions in this fashion, they will develop a feel for a particular concept.

This question is very simple and designed to help students make sure they understand this syntax before they are asked more complicated questions:

> Into the command window you have entered
>
> `data = [10 -10 -20 10]`
>
> Then, you enter
>
> `data <= 0`
>
> What is the output?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div class = 'half'>
                    <figure>
                      <img src = 'pic/question_array.jpg'>

                  <div class = 'half'>
                    <div class = 'md'>
Hints
-----
Also problematic is the ITS hint structure. Students will either use them too much such that the ITS answers the question for them, or they will ignore the hints and not learn. Our ITS...

- automatically shows one hint after the student answers a question incorrectly. This way, students do not need to know enough to ask for more help. 
- only provides one hint level. If the does not understand, he will be asked a different question.




                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div class = 'half'>
                    <figure>
                      <img src = 'pic/question_array_hint.jpg'>
                    </figure>
                  </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class = 'container row'>
                  <div class = 'center'><h1 class = 'page'>Algorithm</h1></div>
                </div>
                
                <div class = 'row container'>
                  <div class = 'full'>
                    <div class = 'md'>
Keeping score
---------------
A student's estimated competence level on one skill is represented as a number. A student starts at `2.0` and every answer changes the number:

- correct answer: `+0.25`
- correct answer after hint: `+0.15`
- incorrect answer after hint: `-0.35`

Question level
--------------
Every question is assigned a difficulty level. A difficulty of `1` is fairly easy, and a difficulty of `2` is rather tricky. The system has support for higher (and lower) levels of questions. 

Serve a question
-----------
Questions should match the student's estimated competency level. To serve a question, the ITS

1. gets the student's competency level for the skill
2. truncates the result to yield an integer that corresponds to a difficulty level
3. asks a random question with the specified difficulty level

Evaluating an answer
--------------------

4. First attempt
    - If the answer is correct, the ITS serves a new question. 
    - If not, it re-displays the question and displays a hint
5. Second attempt
    - Regardless of answer, the ITS serves a new question. 

Pedagogy
----------
An initial question level of `2` means the ITS first asks the student a fairly difficult question. If the student answers correctly, he will continue to see more difficult questions. If he answers incorrectly, the system will offer him easier questions until he learns enough to correctly answer the easy questions. Once he reaches a higher competency level, he will see more difficult questions.

This algorithm means that:

- advanced students are challenged without wading through lots of easy questions 
- struggling students receive questions at their level
- once struggling students start to understand the content, they start to see more advanced questions. If they cannot handle the more advanced content, they will return to the easier questions.

                  <div class = 'half'>
                    <div class = 'md'>
Server stack
-----
The ITS is written in [Python](http://www.python.org) using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) framework and a [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/products/community/) database. [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org) is used to serve static webpages and interface with the user's web browser.

This stack is comparable to the stack that powers Instagram, Pintrest, and other modern web applications.

Front end
---------
The front end that the user sees is written using modern techniques in pure HTML and CSS.
